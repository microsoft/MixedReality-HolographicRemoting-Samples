# Holographic Remoting Samples

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

| Holographic Remoting version |
:-----------------: |
|2.7.0 |

The [Holographic Remoting Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-HolographicRemoting-Samples) repository hosts sample applications for [Holographic Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/holographic-remoting-player). The two remote samples show how to write an application for streaming content to a Microsoft HoloLens 2 or a PC running Windows Mixed Reality.

| Sample | Platform | Runtime |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| remote | HoloLens 2, PC | Mixed Reality |
| remote_openxr | HoloLens 2, PC | OpenXR |

The player sample shows how to write an application running on your Microsoft HoloLens 2 or a Windows Mixed Reality PC and receive streamed content, using the Mixed Reality runtime. The player sample is very similar to the [Holographic Remoting Player available in the Microsoft store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/holographic-remoting-player/9nblggh4sv40).

| Sample | Platform | Runtime |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| player | HoloLens 2, PC | Mixed Reality |

## Setup

Clone or download this sample repository.

### Mixed Reality

1. Open one of the ```.sln``` files either under ```player/``` or ```remote/```. 
2. On first use, right-click the solution and select **Restore NuGet Packages**.

For more information, please refer to the official [Mixed Reality documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/).

### OpenXR

1. Open the ```.sln``` file under ```remote_openxr```. 
2. On first use, right-click the solution and select **Restore NuGet Packages**.

For more information, please refer to the official [OpenXR reference](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/).

## Running the samples

Build and run. When running the remote app, pass the ip address of your HoloLens device as first argument to the application.

## Key concepts 

The `player` sample application lets you customize the remote player experience using public APIs and the latest Holographic Remoting packages. If you don't need customization, use the [pre-packaged version on the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/holographic-remoting-player/9nblggh4sv40).

Use the `remote` and `remote_openxr` samples to implement remoting functionality into a custom engine using C++. If you're using Unity or Unreal, this feature is already built-in.

## Best practices

Check out the [Holographic Remoting Player documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/platform-capabilities-and-apis/holographic-remoting-player) for information on quality, performance, diagnostics, and system requirements.
